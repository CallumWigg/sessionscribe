TODO
-Would be great to have one python script at the top which did everything: convert file type, run transcribe, update combined transcription, update dictionary.
-Script in top level.
-Convert all transcription files to have same name scheme.
-Update dictionary automatically when run the transcription combine script
-README to include the ideal file formatting and naming etc.
-Combine all into one. Have a menu similar to the windows cracker with options:
[1] Update Dictionary (to be combined in top lvl)
[2] Sort Dictionary (alphabetical/uncorrected)
[3] Perform Corrections
[4] Exit
