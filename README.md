## TODO  
- [ ] Would be great to have one python script at the top which did everything: convert file type, run transcribe, update combined transcription, update dictionary.
- [ ] Script in top level.
- [ ] Convert all transcription files to have same name scheme.
- [ ] Set file metadata too
- [ ] Update dictionary automatically when run the transcription combine script
- [ ] setup requirements.txt
- [ ] strip all the non cp1252 characters
- [ ] indicate format of dnd_dictionary
- [ ] unify naming conventions
- [ ] Combine all into one. Have a menu with options:  
>   	[1] Update Dictionary (to be combined in top lvl)  
>       [2] Sort Dictionary (alphabetical/uncorrected)  
>       [3] Perform Corrections  
>       [4] Exit
